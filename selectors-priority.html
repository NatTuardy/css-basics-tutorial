  </section>

  <!-- Section: ID Selector -->
  <section>

  <!-- Section: Inline Style -->
  <section>

  </section>

  <!-- Section: !important -->
  <section>
    <h2>Using !important</h2>
    <p>The <strong>!important</strong> rule is used to override all other styles, including inline styles. It should be used sparingly as it makes code less flexible.</p>
    <p id="important-text" class="text override">This paragraph is styled using the !important rule, which overrides all other styles.</p>
